# Drag-Racer-Kinematics-Simulation

Models the motion of a drag racer over an 8-meter distance. The vehicle accelerates until it reaches its top speed, then continues at constant velocity until it crosses the finish line. Values are tracked and graphed.

---

## Description and Tracked Values

- Acceleration phase (until top speed is reached)
- Constant-speed cruising phase
- Position over time
- Simple time-stepped loop with conditional logic

---

## Features

- Conditional kinematics based on speed
- Plots motion 
- Physics-based simulation using constant acceleration and velocity

---

## Concepts Demonstrated

- Piecewise motion simulation
- Velocity and position updates with time steps
- Plotting and time-based modeling
- Conditional logic in loops

---

## How to Run

1. Download `drag_racer_simulation.m`
2. Open in [Octave Online](https://octave-online.net/) or another MATLAB IDE
3. Run the script
4. View the plot of position vs. time and velocity vs. time to analyze performance
